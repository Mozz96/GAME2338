# Game Critique - Sunset Overdrive

Sunset Overdrive is a third-person shooter/action-adventure game created by Insomniac Games, known for the Spyro games and more recently Spiderman for the Playstation 4, in 2014. It stars a character created by the player, escaping from the clutches of a dead-end job in Sunset City when the energy drink company FizzCo accidentally creates monsters out of people who drink their latest product Overcharge. The energy drink fueled apocolypse (named the Awesomepocolypse by the characters) allows for the player to go on a surprisingly fun, lighthearted, and silly adventure to escape the city while doing so with the best traversal mechanics I've seen in a long time. It also features a online co-op mode for up to 8 players, which is not very active these days but still very fun. The game is absolutely feature-packed, and there are several functions that a tester should look at.

One such function would be the traversal system itself, as it's the main and quickest way to navigate the city; it should be tested to make sure every mechanic is working as intended. Another function that would be tested is the weapon system, making sure that all weapons fire correctly, level up as intended, and are able to receive upgrades. Something else that would need to be tested would be the city itself, testing to see if there are objects that aren't traversable or if there are any holes in the map. Multiplayer is also a very important function to test, making sure that all players are in-sync and can connect to the game, while also keeping the progress of each individual player intact. Other functions that may need testing would be enemy AI, ammo and health pickups, and side quests.

Sunset Overdrive is a very large game with lots of content and features, it would definitely need to have all of them tested to make sure everything is in working order.
