# Game Review 4 - Dragalia Lost

## Details:
Game Title: Dragalia Lost
Platform: Android, iOS
Year 2018

## Summary:
Dragalia Lost is a mobile casual RPG that has been released ***very*** recently by Nintendo, not even a week old as of the time of writing this review. It follows the story of Euden, the 6th prince and heir to the throne of the fictional world of Alberia, and his companions: his sister the High Auspex Zethia, a kind yet very blunt Faerie named Notte, the battle-hardened but compassionate mercenary Ranzal, and the straightforward and kind-hearted paladin Elisanne. 

Euden is sent by his father the king to in order to recover one of the Sacred Shards, a piece of a crystal that can repel gruesome monsters called Fiends. The only way one can transport said crystals is by making a pact with one of the 6 Greatwyrms, a feat can only be accomplished by those with dragonblood in their veins, which the royal bloodline have. After making a pact with Midgardsormr, the Windwyrm, Euden's goal is within reach when out of the blue, his father or rather an impostor bearing his likeness comes out of a strange portal and steals the Sacred Shard *and* Zethia, injuring Euden in the process. When the prince comes to, his homeland has been overtaken by the impostor, bearing the name of a long-dead evil empire known as the Dyrenell Empire. Euden must form a pact with the other 5 Greatwyrms if he is to have any chance of taking back his land and his beloved sister.

Dragalia Lost's gameplay is much simpler than it's story thankfully. You control your character by grabbing and dragging a cursor created when you touch your phone's screen, and then tap to attack. It's simple enough, but combat gets very addicting when you're defeating enemies left and right, and quests are short enough to be completed in bite-sized chunks, perfect for when you're on the go. The game is a part of Japan's "Gacha" genre, which means that getting more adventurers and useful items depends on summoning. Summoning can be done with real money, but you get the game's currency enough to not have to do so.
## Thoughts (Final and Otherwise):
It may have only come out less than a week ago (at the time of writing), but Dragalia Lost has certainly earned my interest. The story is pretty good if not a bit generic, the characters are interesting and likeable, and the gameplay is very addicting. I can certainly recommend the game to anyone else that likes these types of casual but deep experiences.
