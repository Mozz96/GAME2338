## Details:

## Summary:
Terraria is a side-scroller survival sandbox game by Re-Logic, one that's been compared near countless times to Minecraft. At face value, that may be just what it is: a 2D version of Minecraft. Once you get into the game's inner workings however, it becomes much, *much* more than that, with overarching objectives that become more apparent as you play. 

Upon starting the game, you have the ability to create your own character, giving them your own unique flair. Afterwards, you're able to create your own world, with the options of inputting your own world seed and it's world size. You start out simple enough, spawning in a world that's been randomly generated with nothing but a pickaxe and your imagination at your disposal. A single NPC is also there, giving you general tips and tricks. As you begin to build and create structures, most notably houses, additional NPCs arrive begin to arrive, offering new items such as weapons and decorations. 

During your adventures, you'll be able to encounter difficult but rewarding boss fights, either through exploration or strange items that you can build in order to summon them. Each boss contributes to getting one step closer to fighting the first final boss, hidden deep underground. Even after defeating said "final" boss, the true challenge begins as in order to continue the journey, the difficulty must be turned up to progress. If you just want to build and enjoy the world you've created however, you can stay at the current difficulty and play to your heart's content.

## Thoughts (Final and Otherwise):
While Minecraft may the more well-known of the two from a mainstream perspective, Terraria isn't without merit, it being one of the best-selling PC games of all time. Terraria is a really sandbox game, especially with friends and mods enabled; the possibilities really are endless, allowing for one to really cut loose and build whatever their mind comes up with. It's one of the more cathartic games I've personally played, which provides a peaceful yet well executed experience that I'll certainly enjoy for years to come.
