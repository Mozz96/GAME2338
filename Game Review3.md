## Details:

* Year: 2012

## Summary:
Dishonored is a stealth-action game created by Arkane Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. The player is put in the shoes of Corvo Attano, the former bodyguard of the Empress of Dunwall, an industrial city suffering from a horrific plague. He had been framed for both her murder and the kidnapping of her daughter by one of her advisors, planning to take the throne for him and his cronies. After breaking out of prison with the help of a group loyal to the Empress, fittingly called The Loyaiists, Corvo gets ready to get back at his framers, but not before being imbued with supernatural powers by a being known only as The Outsider. Armed with these powers and brand new gear, Corvo sets out on a mission with a single central objective: revenge.

## Thoughts (Final and Otherwise):
I highly recommend that anybody who loves stealth games play Dishonored, it's one of my personal favorite games of all time. It's a masterclass in stealth games, allowing the player to explore the level and tackle the objective in several ways, either lethal or non-lethal. Each mission is open ended enough to allow creative minds to finish the level without combat or even getting spotted. With the supernatural powers at the player's disposal, along with the amount of options each level presents, Dishonored is certainly one of the best stealth games the genre has to offer.
