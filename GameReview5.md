# Game Review - Payday 2

## Details:
* Game Title: Payday 2
* Platform: Xbox, Playstation, PC, Switch 
* Year: 2013

## Summary:
Payday 2 is the sequel to Payday: The Heist, created by Overkill Software. It is a first person shooter with a heavy emphasis on cooperative play. The game follows the exploits of the Payday Gang, a group of world-class robbers and criminals (and a few guest characters) that have banded together to take on daring heists that were previously thought impossible, thanks to the mastermind known only as Bain. 

The game itself consists of choosing your heister from an extensive catalogue (which is purely cosmetic), choosing your mask and customizing it to make it unique, and then creating your loadout. Payday 2â€™s weaponry varies from the conventional to the absurd, ranging from pistols and assault rifles to rocket launchers and miniguns. You are also able to choose a perk deck and create a skill set. Doing so will enable you to customize your role in a heist, from a bullet soaking tank, a damage-dodging quickster, a stealthy assassin, or anything in between. Playing co-op is *the* way to play Payday 2, communication is key when doing heists, and it enhances the experience much more when playing with others. 

## Thoughts (Final and Otherwise):
Having clocked hundreds upon hundred of hours in the game since purchasing it back in 2016, I can tell you now that Payday 2 is one of the funnest co-op FPS games I've ever played. While it can at times be frustrating with the people that may join a lobby, the good experiences outnumber the bad exponentially. I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anybody looking for a good game about nailing the perfect heist.
