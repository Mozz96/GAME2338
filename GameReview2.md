# Game Review - Tales from the Borderlands

## Details:
* Game Title: Tales from the Borderlands
* Platform: Xbox, Playstation, Windows, Mac, Android, iOS
* Year: 2014

## Summary:
Widely considered to be one of Telltale Games' best, Tales from the Borderlands is , of course, based in the universe of the Borderlands series. Taking place after the events of Borderlands 2, players take control of the main characters Rhys, an employee of the evil Hyperion Corporation, and Fiona, a con artist working with her sister and her mentor to get rich. Both characters' stories are interlinked, being told after-the-fact (at least where I stopped).

## Thoughts (Final and Otherwise):
I have to say, I can definitely see why people consider this game to be so good. The series' trademark humor is ever present throughout, and it's well balanced with the exploration elements along with the mini action sequences and quick decisions that Telltale is known for. The game features cameos from several series mainstays; as someone that's played both main Borderlands games, it felt natural in how the characters showed up while not being too confusing for players who had never even touched one of the games before. All in all, I highly recommend for people Tale from the Borderlands.
