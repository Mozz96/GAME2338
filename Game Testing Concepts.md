### 1. After watching some the testing activities required to test Halo, name two skills that are important for a tester to have?
As a tester, one important skill to have would be a keen eye, in order to see any bugs that others may not see at first. A second important skill that a tester should have would be a creative mind. As bizarre as that might sound, players are going to try to break a game in many ways, like get out of a map. If a tester has the mindset of a player and gets creative like one, they could prevent said breaking from happening at launch.

### 2. What do you think is hardest about being a tester based watching the video?
I believe that the sheer volume one might record would be the hardest part of being a tester. In the videos, it said at the time of recording Halo 3 had over 30000 bugs in total, which must have be an absolute nightmare to find and have to document (as well as fix on the coder's side of things).

### 3. What is something new you learned about being a tester? Or something you found interesting?
Something that I found very interesting while watching these videos was learning more about the testing aspect of one of my favorite games of all time.
