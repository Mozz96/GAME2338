# Game Critique - Spyro: Reignited Trilogy

Spyro: Reignited Trilogy is a remaster of the first three Spyro the Dragon games, the originals being made by Insomniac Games while the remaster is made by Toys For Bob. Spyro: Reignited Trilogy tells of the adventures of Spyro, a small purple dragon with big amounts of bravery, and his friend, a quiet but friendly dragonfly named Sparx. Together, through three games, they thwart the plots of big bad evildoers by platforming, collecting gems, and flame-breathing any bad guy that stands in their way. With three full-fledged games in this collection, Spyro: Reignited Trilogy features a varied amount of functions that tester may look at.

One function that should be tested immediately is the main menu, in order to be certain that all three games load as intended. Another function that should be tested is the individual games' save data, to ensure that it will save the player's progress on a particular game correctly and not overwrite one another when switching games. Going into gameplay, player control is extremely important to test, making sure that Spyro's basic movement along with his charge, flame breath, glide, and other platforming abilities all work as intended. A function that would also need testing is collision detection, it being very important due to the need to collect gems and fight enemies requiring Spyro to interact with them in some form. Other functions that could be tested would be the various power-ups, the timer system in the various time trials, and the overall progress checker for each game.

The Spyro games are great experiences, and some of my all-time favorite games, and learning more about game testing has shown me that there were lots of different functions that needed to be tested and refined even back in the Insomniac days, in order to make the games as fun and polished as they are today.
