# Game Critique - Enter the Gungeon

Enter the Gungeon is a rogue-like dungeon crawler, created by Dodge Roll and published by Devolver Digital. It involves 4 playable characters (6 in all through unlockables) using a huge and very wacky arsenal of guns to traverse 5 randomly generated floors of a mysterious place known only as the Gungeon, in order to destroy their pasts. It provides a near endless amount of replayability and allows for two player co-op. With it's many features, there are many funcions that a tester should look at.

The first function that could be immmediately tested would be the character selection screen, in order to make sure that all characters can be selected. Another function that could be tested immediately would be making sure that the player character can actually enter the Gungeon itself, due to there being a hub area before gameplay begins. Combat would be a very important function to test, making sure that the player's starting weapon works as intended, while also checking to see if the enemy AI works and will fire their weapons correctly as well. Other functions that could be tested would be loot drops, boss enemy AI, and shops.

All of these functions be integral to the experience that Enter the Gungeon provides, and would need to be tested in order to make sure that things are as they should be.
